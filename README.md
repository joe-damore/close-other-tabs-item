# Close Other Tabs Menu Item

[![Add-Ons for Firefox | Close Other Tabs Menu Item v1.0.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firefox%20Add--Ons-v1.0.4-722291)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/close-other-tabs-item/)

Firefox extension that adds a "Close Other Tabs" context menu item in Firefox v78+.

## Overview
Beginning with v78, Firefox's _Close Tabs to the Right_ and _Close Other Tabs_ menu items have been moved to a submenu within the tab context menus.

Installing this extension will add a _Close Other Tabs_ menu item to the root of your tab context menu, reducing some of the friction when closing tabs in Firefox v78 and beyond.

## Usage
Once this extension is installed and enabled, a _Close Other Tabs_ menu item will immediately be available when right-clicking on a tab.

This menu item can be triggered using the `o` access key. This means that the _Close Other Tabs_ menu item can be invoked by right-clicking a tab and pressing the `o` key on your keyboard, similar to versions of Firefox prior to v78.

Pinned tabs do not get closed when using this menu item.
